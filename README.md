# McGraw Tower Defense

## MTD is a Cornell-themed spinoff of the famous __Bloons Tower Defense__ game written in OCaml by Chris Fernandes, Gerardo Montemayor, Rolando Rodríguez, and Alex Spero.

We envisioned our game being a tower defense-style game with waves of oncoming enemies (balloons) that are popped by towers (bears) that the user can strategically place along the map. The user will have two important variables to monitor that are crucial to the game’s strategy: cash, the currency for buying and upgrading towers, and lives, which are self-explanatory. As the game progresses and waves get harder, the user has to carefully weigh their options to stay alive and defend McGraw Tower.
We made the game as hard as possible while still being beatable. To win, you’ll need to place bears in the spots that best bring out their abilities and combine different bears together to keep going.
